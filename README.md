Launch 2 instances from the same RHEL7 AMI and wait for it to pass status checks. 
Stop both instances, detach the volume from one instance and attach it to the other instance.
Obtain the UUID of the original root partition. It should be the same for both instances. Replace the UUID value in the script.
Execute the script on the instance with both volumes attached.
Follow the instructions given at the end of the script based on which volume is partitioned.
